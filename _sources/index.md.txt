# SPARC-X-API: A Python API for the Real-Space SPARC-X DFT Code

SPARC-X-API is a versatile Python API for the real-space density
functional (DFT) package [SPARC](https://github.com/SPARC-X/SPARC)
(**S**imulation **P**ackage for **A**b-initio **R**eal-**S**pace
**C**alculations) distributed under the GPLv3 license. SPARC-X-API
leverages the powerful Atomic Simulation Environment
([ASE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/)) framework for manipulating
input / output files, as well as running DFT calculations and analysis
via the SPARC code written in C/C++. Through SPARC-X-API, users can
easily integrate real-space SPARC calculations seamlessly into their
existing atomistic simulation workflows, thanks to the calculator
interface provided by ASE.
