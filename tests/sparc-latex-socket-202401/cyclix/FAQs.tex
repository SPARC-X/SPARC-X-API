\noindent
{\bf Q:} How can SCF convergence be made better in SPARC-cyclix calculations?
 \\
{\color{blue} {\bf A:} In cases of smaller radius and finer mesh, we need to use higher Chebyshev Degree. Increasing the option CHEB\_DEGREE should help with the SCF convergence. }\\

{\bf Q:} Are pseudopotentials with non-linear core corrections and relativistic effect supported by SPARC-cyclix?
 \\
{\color{blue} {\bf A:} Yes.}\\

{\bf Q:} Is non-collinear spin calculation supported by SPARC-cyclix?
 \\
{\color{blue} {\bf A:} No, currently we only have the collinear spin calculations available in SPARC-cyclix.}\\
